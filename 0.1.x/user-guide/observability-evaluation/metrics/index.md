# Metrics

Metrics are essential for understanding agent performance, optimizing behavior, and monitoring resource usage. The Strands Agents SDK provides comprehensive metrics tracking capabilities that give you visibility into how your agents operate.

## Overview

The Strands Agents SDK automatically tracks key metrics during agent execution:

- **Token usage**: Input tokens, output tokens, and total tokens consumed
- **Performance metrics**: Latency and execution time measurements
- **Tool usage**: Call counts, success rates, and execution times for each tool
- **Event loop cycles**: Number of reasoning cycles and their durations

All these metrics are accessible through the [`AgentResult`](../../../api-reference/agent/#strands.agent.agent_result.AgentResult) object that's returned whenever you invoke an agent:

```
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator

# Create an agent with tools
agent = Agent(tools=[calculator])

# Invoke the agent with a prompt and get an AgentResult
result = agent("What is the square root of 144?")

# Access metrics through the AgentResult
print(f"Total tokens: {result.metrics.accumulated_usage['totalTokens']}")
print(f"Execution time: {sum(result.metrics.cycle_durations):.2f} seconds")
print(f"Tools used: {list(result.metrics.tool_metrics.keys())}")

```

The `metrics` attribute of `AgentResult` (an instance of [`EventLoopMetrics`](../../../api-reference/telemetry/#strands.telemetry.metrics) provides comprehensive performance metric data about the agent's execution, while other attributes like `stop_reason`, `message`, and `state` provide context about the agent's response. This document explains the metrics available in the agent's response and how to interpret them.

## EventLoopMetrics

The `EventLoopMetrics` class aggregates metrics across the entire event loop execution cycle, providing a complete picture of your agent's performance.

### Key Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description | | --- | --- | --- | | `cycle_count` | `int` | Number of event loop cycles executed | | `tool_metrics` | `Dict[str, ToolMetrics]` | Metrics for each tool used, keyed by tool name | | `cycle_durations` | `List[float]` | List of durations for each cycle in seconds | | `traces` | `List[Trace]` | List of execution traces for detailed performance analysis | | `accumulated_usage` | `Usage` (TypedDict) | Accumulated token usage across all model invocations | | `accumulated_metrics` | `Metrics` (TypedDict) | Accumulated performance metrics across all model invocations |

## `tool_metrics`

For each tool used by the agent, detailed metrics are collected in the `tool_metrics` dictionary. Each entry is an instance of `ToolMetrics` with the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description | | --- | --- | --- | | `tool` | `ToolUse` (TypedDict) | Reference to the tool being tracked | | `call_count` | `int` | Number of times the tool has been called | | `success_count` | `int` | Number of successful tool calls | | `error_count` | `int` | Number of failed tool calls | | `total_time` | `float` | Total execution time across all calls in seconds |

### `accumulated_usage`

This attribute tracks token usage with the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description | | --- | --- | --- | | `inputTokens` | `int` | Number of tokens sent in requests to the model | | `outputTokens` | `int` | Number of tokens generated by the model | | `totalTokens` | `int` | Total number of tokens (input + output) |

### `accumulated_metrics`

The attribute contains:

| Property | Type | Description | | --- | --- | --- | | `latencyMs` | `int` | Total latency of model requests in milliseconds |

## Example Metrics Summary Output

The Strands Agents SDK provides a convenient `get_summary()` method on the `EventLoopMetrics` class that gives you a comprehensive overview of your agent's performance in a single call. This method aggregates all the metrics data into a structured dictionary that's easy to analyze or export.

Let's look at the output from calling `get_summary()` on the metrics from our calculator example from the beginning of this document:

```
result = agent("What is the square root of 144?")
print(result.metrics.get_summary())

```

This summary provides a complete picture of the agent's execution, including cycle information, token usage, tool performance, and detailed execution traces.

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Token Usage**: Keep track of `accumulated_usage` to ensure you stay within token limits and optimize costs. Set up alerts for when token usage approaches predefined thresholds to avoid unexpected costs.
1. **Analyze Tool Performance**: Review `tool_metrics` to identify tools with high error rates or long execution times. Consider refactoring tools with success rates below 95% or average execution times that exceed your latency requirements.
1. **Track Cycle Efficiency**: Use `cycle_count` and `cycle_durations` to understand how many iterations the agent needed and how long each took. Agents that require many cycles may benefit from improved prompting or tool design.
1. **Benchmark Latency Metrics**: Monitor the `latencyMs` values in `accumulated_metrics` to establish performance baselines. Compare these metrics across different agent configurations to identify optimal setups.
1. **Regular Metrics Reviews**: Schedule periodic reviews of agent metrics to identify trends and opportunities for optimization. Look for gradual changes in performance that might indicate drift in tool behavior or model responses.
