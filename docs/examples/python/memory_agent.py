# ðŸ§  Memory Agent

A demonstration of using Strands Agents' memory capabilities to store and retrieve information.

## What This Example Shows

This example demonstrates:
- Creating an agent with memory capabilities
- Storing information for later retrieval
- Retrieving relevant memories based on context
- Using memory to create personalized responses

## Usage Examples

Basic usage:
```
python memory_agent.py
```

Import in your code:
```python
from examples.basic.memory_agent import memory_agent

# Store a memory
response = memory_agent("Remember that I prefer tea over coffee")
print(response["message"]["content"][0]["text"])

# Retrieve memories
response = memory_agent("What do I prefer to drink?")
print(response["message"]["content"][0]["text"])
```

## Memory Operations

1. **Store Information**:
   - "Remember that I like hiking"
   - "Note that I have a dog named Max"
   - "I want you to know I prefer window seats"

2. **Retrieve Information**:
   - "What do you know about me?"
   - "What are my hobbies?"
   - "Do I have any pets?"

3. **List All Memories**:
   - "Show me everything you remember"
   - "What memories do you have stored?"
