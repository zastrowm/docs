# Deploying Strands Agents to Google's Cloud Run Platform

[Google Cloud Run](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/overview/what-is-cloud-run) is a fully managed serverless platform that automatically scales your containerized applications from zero to thousands of instances based on incoming requests. It provides a simple way to deploy and run Strands agents without managing infrastructure, offering automatic scaling, built-in load balancing, and pay-per-use pricing.
