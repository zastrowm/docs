# Build chat experiences with AG-UI and CopilotKit

{{ community_contribution_banner }}

As an agent builder, you want users to interact with your agents through a rich
and responsive interface. Building UIs from scratch requires a lot of effort,
especially to support streaming events and client state. That's exactly what
[AG-UI](https://docs.ag-ui.com/) was designed for - rich user experiences
directly connected to an agent.

[AG-UI](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui) provides a consistent interface
to empower rich clients across technology stacks, from mobile to the web and
even the command line. There are a number of different clients that support
AG-UI:

- [CopilotKit](https://copilotkit.ai) provides tooling and components to tightly integrate your agent with web applications
- Clients for [Kotlin](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/sdks/community/kotlin), [Java](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/sdks/community/java), [Go](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/sdks/community/go/example/client), and [CLI implementations](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/apps/client-cli-example/src) in TypeScript

This tutorial uses CopilotKit to create a sample app backed by a Strands agent that
demonstrates some of the features supported by AG-UI.

## Quickstart

To get started, let's create a sample application with a Strands agent and a simple
web client:

```
npx copilotkit create -f aws-strands-py
```

### Chat

Chat is a familiar interface for exposing your agent, and AG-UI handles
streaming messages between your users and agents:

```jsx title="src/app/page.tsx"
const labels = {
    title: "Popup Assistant",
    initial: "Hi, there! You\'re chatting with an agent. This agent comes with a few tools to get you started."
  }
<CopilotSidebar
  clickOutsideToClose={false}
  defaultOpen={true}
  labels={labels}
/>
```

Learn more about the chat UI
[in the CopilotKit docs](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/aws-strands/agentic-chat-ui).

### Tool Based Generative UI (Rendering Tools)

AG-UI lets you share tool information with a Generative UI so that it can be
displayed to users:

```jsx title="src/app/page.tsx"
useCopilotAction({
  name: "get_weather",
  description: "Get the weather for a given location.",
  available: "disabled",
  parameters: [
    { name: "location", type: "string", required: true },
  ],
  render: ({ args }) => {
    return <WeatherCard location={args.location} themeColor={themeColor} />
  },
});
```

Learn more about the Tool-based Generative UI
[in the CopilotKit docs](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/aws-strands/generative-ui/tool-based).

### Shared State

Strands agents are stateful, and synchronizing that state between your agents and
your UIs enables powerful and fluid user experiences. State can be synchronized
both ways so agents are automatically aware of changes made by your user or
other parts of your application:

```jsx
const { state, setState } = useCoAgent<AgentState>({
  name: "my_agent",
  initialState: {
    proverbs: [
      "CopilotKit may be new, but its the best thing since sliced bread.",
    ],
  },
})
```

[in the CopilotKit docs](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/aws-strands/shared-state).

### Try it out!

```
npm install && npm run dev
```
