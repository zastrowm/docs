# Tools Overview

Tools are the primary mechanism for extending agent capabilities, enabling them to perform actions beyond simple text generation. Tools allow agents to interact with external systems, access data, and manipulate their environment.

Strands offers built-in example tools to get started quickly experimenting with agents and tools during development. For more information, see [Example Built-in Tools](../example-tools-package/).

## Adding Tools to Agents

Tools are passed to agents during initialization or at runtime, making them available for use throughout the agent's lifecycle. Once loaded, the agent can use these tools in response to user requests:

```
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator, file_read, shell

# Add tools to our agent
agent = Agent(
    tools=[calculator, file_read, shell]
)

# Agent will automatically determine when to use the calculator tool
agent("What is 42 ^ 9")

print("\n\n")  # Print new lines

# Agent will use the shell and file reader tool when appropriate
agent("Show me the contents of a single file in this directory")

```

We can see which tools are loaded in our agent in `agent.tool_names`, along with a JSON representation of the tools in `agent.tool_config` that also includes the tool descriptions and input parameters:

```
print(agent.tool_names)

print(agent.tool_config)

```

Tools can also be loaded by passing a file path to our agents during initialization:

```
agent = Agent(tools=["/path/to/my_tool.py"])

```

## Auto-loading and reloading tools

Tools placed in your current working directory `./tools/` can be automatically loaded at agent initialization, and automatically reloaded when modified. This can be really useful when developing and debugging tools: simply modify the tool code and any agents using that tool will reload it to use the latest modifications!

Automatic loading and reloading of tools in the `./tools/` directory is enabled by default with the `load_tools_from_directory=True` parameter passed to `Agent` during initialization. To disable this behavior, simply set `load_tools_from_directory=False`:

```
from strands import Agent

agent = Agent(load_tools_from_directory=False)

```

## Using Tools

Tools can be invoked in two primary ways.

Agents have context about tool calls and their results as part of conversation history. See [sessions & state](../../agents/sessions-state/#tool-state) for more information.

### Natural Language Invocation

The most common way agents use tools is through natural language requests. The agent determines when and how to invoke tools based on the user's input:

```
# Agent decides when to use tools based on the request
agent("Please read the file at /path/to/file.txt")

```

### Direct Method Calls

Every tool added to an agent also becomes a method accessible directly on the agent object. This is useful for programmatically invoking tools:

```
# Directly invoke a tool as a method
result = agent.tool.file_read(path="/path/to/file.txt", mode="view")

```

If a tool name contains hyphens, you can invoke the tool using underscores instead:

```
# Directly invoke a tool named "read-all"
result = agent.tool.read_all(path="/path/to/file.txt")

```

## Building & Loading Tools

### 1. Python Tools

Build your own Python tools using the Strands SDK's tool interfaces.

#### Function Decorator Approach

Function decorated tools can be placed anywhere in your codebase and imported in to your agent's list of tools. Define any Python function as a tool by using the [`@tool`](../../../../api-reference/tools/#strands.tools.decorator.tool) decorator.

```
from strands import Agent, tool

@tool
def get_user_location() -> str:
    """Get the user's location
    """

    # Implement user location lookup logic here
    return "Seattle, USA"

@tool
def weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get weather information for a location

    Args:
        location: City or location name
    """

    # Implement weather lookup logic here
    return f"Weather for {location}: Sunny, 72°F"

agent = Agent(tools=[get_user_location, weather])

# Use the agent with the custom tools
agent("What is the weather like in my location?")

```

#### Module-Based Approach

Tool modules can contain function decorated tools, in this example `get_user_location.py`:

```
# get_user_location.py

from strands import tool

@tool
def get_user_location() -> str:
    """Get the user's location
    """

    # Implement user location lookup logic here
    return "Seattle, USA"

```

Tool modules can also provide single tools that don't use the decorator pattern, instead they define the `TOOL_SPEC` variable and a function matching the tool's name. In this example `weather.py`:

```
# weather.py

from typing import Any
from strands.types.tools import ToolResult, ToolUse

TOOL_SPEC = {
    "name": "weather",
    "description": "Get weather information for a location",
    "inputSchema": {
        "json": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "City or location name"
                }
            },
            "required": ["location"]
        }
    }
}

# Function name must match tool name
def weather(tool: ToolUse, **kwargs: Any) -> ToolResult:
    tool_use_id = tool["toolUseId"]
    location = tool["input"]["location"]

    # Implement weather lookup logic here
    weather_info = f"Weather for {location}: Sunny, 72°F"

    return {
        "toolUseId": tool_use_id,
        "status": "success",
        "content": [{"text": weather_info}]
    }

```

And finally our `agent.py` file that demonstrates loading the decorated `get_user_location` tool from a Python module, and the single non-decorated `weather` tool module:

```
# agent.py

from strands import Agent
import get_user_location
import weather

# Tools can be added to agents through Python module imports
agent = Agent(tools=[get_user_location, weather])

# Use the agent with the custom tools
agent("What is the weather like in my location?")

```

Tool modules can also be loaded by providing their module file paths:

```
from strands import Agent

# Tools can be added to agents through file path strings
agent = Agent(tools=["./get_user_location.py", "./weather.py"])

agent("What is the weather like in my location?")

```

For more details on building custom Python tools, see [Python Tools](../python-tools/).

### 2. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) provides a standardized way to expose and consume tools across different systems. This approach is ideal for creating reusable tool collections that can be shared across multiple agents or applications.

```
from mcp.client.sse import sse_client
from strands import Agent
from strands.tools.mcp import MCPClient

# Connect to an MCP server using SSE transport
sse_mcp_client = MCPClient(lambda: sse_client("http://localhost:8000/sse"))

# Create an agent with MCP tools
with sse_mcp_server:
    # Get the tools from the MCP server
    tools = sse_mcp_client.list_tools_sync()

    # Create an agent with the MCP server's tools
    agent = Agent(tools=tools)

    # Use the agent with MCP tools
    agent("Calculate the square root of 144")

```

For more information on using MCP tools, see [MCP Tools](../mcp-tools/).

### 3. Example Built-in Tools

For rapid prototyping and common tasks, Strands offers an optional [example built-in tools package](https://github.com/strands-agents/tools/blob/main) with pre-built tools for development. These tools cover a wide variety of capabilities including File Operations, Shell & Local System control, Web & Network for API calls, and Agents & Workflows for orchestration.

For a complete list of available tools and their detailed descriptions, see [Example Built-in Tools](../example-tools-package/).

## Tool Design Best Practices

### Effective Tool Descriptions

Language models rely heavily on tool descriptions to determine when and how to use them. Well-crafted descriptions significantly improve tool usage accuracy.

A good tool description should:

- Clearly explain the tool's purpose and functionality
- Specify when the tool should be used
- Detail the parameters it accepts and their formats
- Describe the expected output format
- Note any limitations or constraints

Example of a well-described tool:

```
@tool
def search_database(query: str, max_results: int = 10) -> list:
    """
    Search the product database for items matching the query string.

    Use this tool when you need to find detailed product information based on keywords, 
    product names, or categories. The search is case-insensitive and supports fuzzy 
    matching to handle typos and variations in search terms.

    This tool connects to the enterprise product catalog database and performs a semantic 
    search across all product fields, providing comprehensive results with all available 
    product metadata.

    Example response:
        [
            {
                "id": "P12345",
                "name": "Ultra Comfort Running Shoes",
                "description": "Lightweight running shoes with...",
                "price": 89.99,
                "category": ["Footwear", "Athletic", "Running"]
            },
            ...
        ]

    Notes:
        - This tool only searches the product catalog and does not provide
          inventory or availability information
        - Results are cached for 15 minutes to improve performance
        - The search index updates every 6 hours, so very recent products may not appear
        - For real-time inventory status, use a separate inventory check tool

    Args:
        query: The search string (product name, category, or keywords)
               Example: "red running shoes" or "smartphone charger"
        max_results: Maximum number of results to return (default: 10, range: 1-100)
                     Use lower values for faster response when exact matches are expected

    Returns:
        A list of matching product records, each containing:
        - id: Unique product identifier (string)
        - name: Product name (string)
        - description: Detailed product description (string)
        - price: Current price in USD (float)
        - category: Product category hierarchy (list)
    """

    # Implementation
    pass

```
