# State & Sessions

## State Management

Strands Agents state is maintained in several forms:

1. **Conversation History:** The sequence of messages between the user and the agent.
2. **Agent State**: Stateful information outside of conversation context, maintained across multiple requests.
3. **Request State**: Contextual information maintained within a single request.

Understanding how state works in Strands is essential for building agents that can maintain context across multi-turn interactions and workflows.

### Conversation History

Conversation history is the primary form of context in a Strands agent, directly accessible through the `agent.messages` property:

```python
from strands import Agent

# Create an agent
agent = Agent()

# Send a message and get a response
agent("Hello!")

# Access the conversation history
print(agent.messages)  # Shows all messages exchanged so far
```

The `agent.messages` list contains all user and assistant messages, including tool calls and tool results. This is the primary way to inspect what's happening in your agent's conversation.

You can initialize an agent with existing messages to continue a conversation or pre-fill your Agent's context with information:

```python
from strands import Agent

# Create an agent with initial messages
agent = Agent(messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": [{"text": "Hello, my name is Strands!"}]},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"text": "Hi there! How can I help you today?"}]}
])

# Continue the conversation
agent("What's my name?")
```

Conversation history is automatically:

- Maintained between calls to the agent
- Passed to the model during each inference
- Used for tool execution context
- Managed to prevent context window overflow

#### Direct Tool Calling

Direct tool calls are (by default) recorded in the conversation history:

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator

agent = Agent(tools=[calculator])

# Direct tool call with recording (default behavior)
agent.tool.calculator(expression="123 * 456")

# Direct tool call without recording
agent.tool.calculator(expression="765 / 987", record_direct_tool_call=False)

print(agent.messages)
```

In this example we can see that the first `agent.tool.calculator()` call is recorded in the agent's conversation history.

The second `agent.tool.calculator()` call is **not** recorded in the history because we specified the `record_direct_tool_call=False` argument.

#### Conversation Manager

Strands uses a conversation manager to handle conversation history effectively. The default is the [`SlidingWindowConversationManager`](../../../api-reference/agent.md#strands.agent.conversation_manager.sliding_window_conversation_manager.SlidingWindowConversationManager), which keeps recent messages and removes older ones when needed:

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.agent.conversation_manager import SlidingWindowConversationManager

# Create a conversation manager with custom window size
# By default, SlidingWindowConversationManager is used even if not specified
conversation_manager = SlidingWindowConversationManager(
    window_size=10,  # Maximum number of message pairs to keep
)

# Use the conversation manager with your agent
agent = Agent(conversation_manager=conversation_manager)
```

The sliding window conversation manager:

- Keeps the most recent N message pairs
- Removes the oldest messages when the window size is exceeded
- Handles context window overflow exceptions by reducing context
- Ensures conversations don't exceed model context limits

See [`Context Management`](context-management.md) for more information about conversation managers.


### Agent State

Agent state provides key-value storage for stateful information that exists outside of the conversation context. Unlike conversation history, agent state is not passed to the model during inference but can be accessed and modified by tools and application logic.

#### Basic Usage

```python
from strands import Agent

# Create an agent with initial state
agent = Agent(state={"user_preferences": {"theme": "dark"}, "session_count": 0})


# Access state values
theme = agent.state.get("user_preferences")
print(theme)  # {"theme": "dark"}

# Set new state values
agent.state.set("last_action", "login")
agent.state.set("session_count", 1)

# Get entire state
all_state = agent.state.get()
print(all_state)  # All state data as a dictionary

# Delete state values
agent.state.delete("last_action")
```

#### State Validation and Safety

Agent state enforces JSON serialization validation to ensure data can be persisted and restored:

```python
from strands import Agent

agent = Agent()

# Valid JSON-serializable values
agent.state.set("string_value", "hello")
agent.state.set("number_value", 42)
agent.state.set("boolean_value", True)
agent.state.set("list_value", [1, 2, 3])
agent.state.set("dict_value", {"nested": "data"})
agent.state.set("null_value", None)

# Invalid values will raise ValueError
try:
    agent.state.set("function", lambda x: x)  # Not JSON serializable
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

#### Using State in Tools

Agent state is particularly useful for maintaining information across tool executions:

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.tools.decorator import tool

@tool
def track_user_action(action: str, agent: Agent):
    """Track user actions in agent state."""
    # Get current action count
    action_count = agent.state.get("action_count") or 0
    
    # Update state
    agent.state.set("action_count", action_count + 1)
    agent.state.set("last_action", action)
    
    return f"Action '{action}' recorded. Total actions: {action_count + 1}"

@tool
def get_user_stats(agent: Agent):
    """Get user statistics from agent state."""
    action_count = agent.state.get("action_count") or 0
    last_action = agent.state.get("last_action") or "none"
    
    return f"Actions performed: {action_count}, Last action: {last_action}"

# Create agent with tools
agent = Agent(tools=[track_user_action, get_user_stats])

# Use tools that modify and read state
agent("Track that I logged in")
agent("Track that I viewed my profile")
print(f"Actions taken: {agent.state.get('action_count')}")
print(f"Last action: {agent.state.get('last_action')}")
```

### Request State

Each agent interaction maintains a request state dictionary that persists throughout the event loop cycles and is **not** included in the agent's context:

```python
from strands import Agent

def custom_callback_handler(**kwargs):
    # Access request state
    if "request_state" in kwargs:
        state = kwargs["request_state"]
        # Use or modify state as needed
        if "counter" not in state:
            state["counter"] = 0
        state["counter"] += 1
        print(f"Callback handler event count: {state['counter']}")

agent = Agent(callback_handler=custom_callback_handler)

result = agent("Hi there!")

print(result.state)
```

The request state:

- Is initialized at the beginning of each agent call
- Persists through recursive event loop cycles
- Can be modified by callback handlers
- Is returned in the AgentResult object

## Session Management

A session represents all of the stateful information that is needed by an agent to function. For applications requiring persistent sessions across separate interactions, Strands provides several approaches:

### 1. Object Persistence

The simplest approach is to maintain the Agent object across requests:

```python
from strands import Agent

# Create agent once
agent = Agent()

# Use in multiple requests
def handle_request(user_message):
    return agent(user_message)

handle_request("Tell me a fun fact")
handle_request("Tell me a related fact")
```

### 2. Serialization and Restoration

For distributed systems or applications that can't maintain object references:

```python
import json
import os
import uuid
from strands import Agent

# Save agent state
def save_agent_state(agent, session_id):
    os.makedirs("sessions", exist_ok=True)

    state = {
        "messages": agent.messages,
        "system_prompt": agent.system_prompt
    }
    # Store state (e.g., database, file system, cache)
    with open(f"sessions/{session_id}.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(state, f)

# Restore agent state
def restore_agent_state(session_id):
    # Retrieve state
    with open(f"sessions/{session_id}.json", "r") as f:
        state = json.load(f)
    
    # Create agent with restored state
    return Agent(
        messages=state["messages"],
        system_prompt=state["system_prompt"]
    )

agent = Agent(system_prompt="Talk like a pirate")
agent_id = uuid.uuid4()

print("Initial agent:")
agent("Where are Octopus found? 🐙")
save_agent_state(agent, agent_id)

# Create a new Agent object with the previous agent's saved state
restored_agent = restore_agent_state(agent_id)
print("\n\nRestored agent:")
restored_agent("What did we just talk about?")

print("\n\n")
print(restored_agent.messages)  # Both messages and responses are in the restored agent's conversation history
```

### 3. Integrating with Web Frameworks

Strands agents can be integrated with web framework session management:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, session
from strands import Agent

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = "your-secret-key"

@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat():
    user_message = request.json["message"]
    
    # Initialize or restore agent conversation history from session
    if "messages" not in session:
        session["messages"] = []
    
    # Create agent with session state
    agent = Agent(messages=session["messages"])
    
    # Process message
    result = agent(user_message)
    
    # Update session with new messages
    session["messages"] = agent.messages
    
    # Return the agent's final message
    return {"response": result.message}
```
