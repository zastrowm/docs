Defined in: [src/types/agent.ts:111](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-typescript/blob/97040b5a028fde61291c32106f76392515fb9984/src/types/agent.ts#L111)

Union type representing all possible streaming events from an agent. This includes model events, tool events, and agent-specific lifecycle events.

This is a discriminated union where each event has a unique type field, allowing for type-safe event handling using switch statements.

Every member extends [HookableEvent](/docs/api/typescript/HookableEvent/index.md) (which extends [StreamEvent](/docs/api/typescript/StreamEvent/index.md)), making all events both streamable and subscribable via hook callbacks. Raw data objects from lower layers (model, tools) should be wrapped in a StreamEvent subclass at the agent boundary rather than added directly.
