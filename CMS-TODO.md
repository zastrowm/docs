# CMS Migration TODO

## Before launch:
- [ ] Remove Vite SSR workaround for zod in `astro.config.mjs` once CMS build is separated from TS verification (see https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/14117)
- [X] Fix relative links to pages (e.g., `../some-page.md` style links need to be converted to Starlight-compatible paths)
- [X] Add API documentation generation/integration for Python and TypeScript SDKs
- [ ] Fix type-checking
- [ ] Look into markdown 
- [X] Add header links to Python/TypeScript method sections (docs/api/python/strands.agent.agent/)
- [ ] Migrate all files and remove conversion scripts
- [ ] Remove `<name>Data` special-case in `scripts/api-generation-typescript.ts` once typedoc fixes the prose or we find a better general solution

## After Launch
- [ ] Move asset files to proper location (currently in `docs/assets/`, should be in `src/content/docs/assets/`)
- [ ] Migrate sidebar from mkdocs.yml to something astro specific (and combine with the navbar?)
- [ ] Remove symlink at `src/content/docs` → `../../docs` and move content to actual location
- [ ] Inline TypeScript code examples directly in markdown and verify via separate type-checking step (e.g., `tsc` on extracted code blocks) instead of snippet includes
- [ ] Update astro-auto-import once https://github.com/delucis/astro-auto-import/pull/110 is merged

## Blog

### Done
- [X] Content collections for blog posts (`src/content/blog/`) and authors (`src/content/authors/`)
- [X] Reading time remark plugin (`src/plugins/remark-reading-time.ts`)
- [X] Blog utilities — `getPublishedPosts`, tag/author filtering, date formatting (`src/util/blog.ts`)
- [X] BlogLayout and BlogPostLayout (reuses Starlight header via mocked starlightRoute)
- [X] Blog components — BlogCard, BlogAuthorByline, BlogTagList, BlogPostGrid
- [X] Blog pages — index, [slug], tags/[tag], authors/[author]
- [X] Blog added to header navigation in `src/config/navbar.ts`
- [X] RSS feeds — main feed + per-tag feeds
- [X] AEO endpoints — raw markdown per post, blog section in llms.txt and llms-full.txt
- [X] OG image generation via `astro-og-canvas`
- [X] robots.txt (public/robots.txt)
- [X] JSON-LD Article structured data on post pages
- [X] Canonical URLs and OG/Twitter meta tags
- [X] Tests for blog utilities and reading time plugin
- [X] Seed content: `hello-world.mdx` post + `strands-team.json` author

### Not Yet Implemented
- [ ] Full-content RSS (currently includes description only, not rendered MDX body)
- [ ] Content negotiation via Accept headers (requires edge/CDN middleware, not SSG-compatible)
- [ ] `x-markdown-tokens` response header on markdown endpoints
- [ ] Markdown sitemap (`/blog/sitemap.md`)
- [ ] Newsletter signup integration
- [ ] OG image custom font (currently uses system sans-serif, not Figtree)
- [ ] Author avatars (schema supports `avatar` field but no images seeded yet)
- [ ] Cover images for posts (schema supports `coverImage` field)
- [ ] Visual design review / polish pass on blog pages
