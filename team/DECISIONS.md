# Decision Record

A record of design and API decisions with their rationale, enabling prior decisions to guide future ones.

## Hooks as Low-Level Primitives, Not High-Level Abstractions

**Date**: Jan 6, 2026

### Decision

Hooks serve as low-level extensibility primitives for the agent loop. High-level constructs SHOULD be built on top of hooks rather than exposing `HookProvider` as the sole developer-facing interface. These higher-level constructs should define their own interface with domain-specific methods and type signatures beyond what `HookProvider` alone provides.

### Rationale

Exposing only `HookProvider` directly to consumers adds complexity to the implementor while offering no guidance on implementation requirements or type safety for specific use cases.

For example, an Agent-provided `retry_strategy` should **not** be implemented as:

```python
def Agent.__init__(
    ...
    retry_strategy: HookProvider
)
```

This is too low-level and gives no guidance on how a retry strategy should be implemented. Instead, a specific interface or base class should be built on top of hooks, providing additional scaffolding:

```python
class RetryStrategy(HookProvider):
  
    def register_hooks(registry):
        ...
    
    @abstractmethod
    def should_retry_model(e: Exception) -> bool:
        """Return true if the model call should be retried based on this exception"""
        ...
    
    def calculate_retry_delay(attempt: int) -> int:
        ...
```

Higher-level abstractions require additional interface definitions, but this tradeoff provides an improved developer experience through explicit contracts. Developers with edge cases can still drop to raw `HookProvider` (and `agent.hooks`) when needed — optimizing for the common path while preserving that escape hatch.


## Prefer Flat Namespaces Over Nested Modules

**Date**: Jan 16, 2026

### Decision

Public APIs should expose commonly-used functionality through flat, top-level namespaces rather than requiring users to import from deeply nested module paths.

### Rationale

Fewer imports are simpler to use and more discoverable when using IDE autocompletion & documentation. While inspired by Python's "Flat is better than nested" (PEP 20 - The Zen of Python), this principle applies across SDK languages.

We don't want users continually importing additional modules for common functionality. The goal is to optimize for the 80% case where users need standard features, while still allowing advanced users to import from specific submodules when needed.

For example, we prefer exporting all hook events from a single module:

```python
from strands.hooks import MultiAgentInitializedEvent
```

instead of categorizing them based on their purpose

```python
from strands.hooks.multiagent import MultiAgentInitializedEvent
```

this is even more important when the event names already indicate their grouping (**MultiAgent**InitializeEvent). 

Internal module organization can remain nested for code maintainability — the key is re-exporting public symbols at common locations.

## When Internal Interfaces Should Extend HookProvider

**Date**: Jan 21, 2026

### Decision

Internal interfaces that integrate with the agent lifecycle (such as `RetryStrategy`, `SessionManager`, and `ConversationManager`) SHOULD extend `HookProvider`. When uncertain whether a new interface requires `HookProvider`, prefer a simple domain interface—it can always be evolved to extend `HookProvider` later, but the reverse migration breaks existing implementations.

### Rationale

The team considered two approaches for `RetryStrategy`: extending `HookProvider` or exposing a simple domain interface with methods like `should_retry(exception, attempt) -> bool`.

While `RetryStrategy` is simple enough that a non-`HookProvider` interface would suffice, extending `HookProvider` maintains a uniform pattern across all agent constructor parameters that integrate with the lifecycle. Users implementing any of these interfaces learn one composition model. This aligns with the **composability** tenet: primitives are building blocks with each other.

The tradeoff is that `HookProvider` exposure can leak implementation details for interfaces with single decision points. Use the following criteria for future interfaces:

**Use a simple interface when:**

- The interface has a single responsibility expressible as one or two methods
- The interface does not need to respond to multiple lifecycle events
- Consistency with existing interfaces is not a priority

**Extend HookProvider when:**

- The capability requires responding to multiple distinct lifecycle events
- Users need to customize which events to subscribe to or add callbacks beyond base class defaults


## Pay for Play: Opt-In Breaking Changes Are Acceptable

**Date**: Jan 28, 2026

### Decision

Small breaking changes that follow the "pay for play" principle are acceptable without a major version bump. Programs can call new APIs to access new features, but programs that choose not to do so are unaffected — old code continues to work as it did before.

### Rationale

Strict semver adherence can slow SDK development when the breaking change only affects users who explicitly adopt new functionality. If existing code paths remain unaffected, the practical impact on users is minimal.

For example, converting a `TypedDict` to `total=False` is technically breaking if existing implementations don't provide the new optional members. However, if the only way to encounter those new members is by adding a new tool that uses the new format, the change is effectively "pay for play." Users who don't adopt the new tool never observe the break.

This applies when the breaking change is gated behind new functionality — users who don't touch the new feature never see the break, and those who do will find the breakage more obvious since it's tied to something they just added.

This doesn't apply when existing code breaks without any user action, or when the change affects default behavior. If someone upgrades and their code stops working with no obvious reason why, that's a bad experience we want to avoid.
