Type definitions for MCP integration.

## MCPToolResult

```python
class MCPToolResult(ToolResult)
```

Defined in: [src/strands/tools/mcp/mcp\_types.py:50](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python/blob/main/src/strands/tools/mcp/mcp_types.py#L50)

Result of an MCP tool execution.

Extends the base ToolResult with MCP-specific structured content support. The structuredContent field contains optional JSON data returned by MCP tools that provides structured results beyond the standard text/image/document content.

**Attributes**:

-   `structuredContent` - Optional JSON object containing structured data returned by the MCP tool. This allows MCP tools to return complex data structures that can be processed programmatically by agents or other tools.
-   `metadata` - Optional arbitrary metadata returned by the MCP tool. This field allows MCP servers to attach custom metadata to tool results (e.g., token usage, performance metrics, or business-specific tracking information).
