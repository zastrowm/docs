# Nova Sonic [Experimental]

{{ experimental_feature_warning() }}

[Amazon Nova Sonic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/nova/latest/userguide/speech.html) provides real-time, conversational interactions through bidirectional audio streaming. Amazon Nova Sonic processes and responds to real-time speech as it occurs, enabling natural, human-like conversational experiences. Key capabilities and features include:

- Adaptive speech response that dynamically adjusts delivery based on the prosody of the input speech.
- Graceful handling of user interruptions without dropping conversational context.
- Function calling and agentic workflow support for building complex AI applications.
- Robustness to background noise for real-world deployment scenarios.
- Multilingual support with expressive voices and speaking styles. Expressive voices are offered, including both masculine-sounding and feminine sounding, in five languages: English (US, UK), French, Italian, German, and Spanish.
- Recognition of varied speaking styles across all supported languages.

## Installation

Nova Sonic is included in the base bidirectional streaming dependencies for Strands Agents.

To install it, run:

```bash
pip install 'strands-agents[bidi]'
```

Or to install all bidirectional streaming providers at once:

```bash
pip install 'strands-agents[bidi-all]'
```

## Usage

After installing `strands-agents[bidi]`, you can import and initialize the Strands Agents' Nova Sonic provider as follows:

```Python
import asyncio

from strands.experimental.bidi import BidiAgent
from strands.experimental.bidi.io import BidiAudioIO, BidiTextIO
from strands.experimental.bidi.models import BidiNovaSonicModel
from strands.experimental.bidi.tools import stop_conversation

from strands_tools import calculator


async def main() -> None:
    model = BidiNovaSonicModel(
        model_id="amazon.nova-sonic-v1:0",
        provider_config={
            "audio": {
                "voice": "tiffany",
            },
        },
        client_config={"region": "us-east-1"},  # only available in us-east-1, eu-north-1, and ap-northeast-1
    )
    # stop_conversation tool allows user to verbally stop agent execution.
    agent = BidiAgent(model=model, tools=[calculator, stop_conversation])

    audio_io = BidiAudioIO()
    text_io = BidiTextIO()
    await agent.run(inputs=[audio_io.input()], outputs=[audio_io.output(), text_io.output()])


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Credentials

!!! warning "Nova Sonic is only available in us-east-1, eu-north-1, and ap-northeast-1."

Nova Sonic requires AWS credentials for access. Under the hook, `BidiNovaSonicModel` uses an experimental [Bedrock client](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-python/tree/develop/clients/aws-sdk-bedrock-runtime/src/aws_sdk_bedrock_runtime), which allows for credentials to be configured in the following ways:

**Option 1: Environment Variables**

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your_session_token  # If using temporary credentials
export AWS_REGION=your_region_name
```

**Option 2: Boto3 Session**

```python
import boto3
from strands.experimental.bidi.models import BidiNovaSonicModel


boto_session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id="your_access_key",
    aws_secret_access_key="your_secret_key",
    aws_session_token="your_session_token",  # If using temporary credentials
    region_name="your_region_name",
    profile_name="your_profile"  # Optional: Use a specific profile
)
model = BidiNovaSonicModel(client_config={"boto_session": boto_session})
```

For more details on this approach, please refer to the [boto3 session docs](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/core/session.html).

## Configuration

### Client Configs

| Parameter | Description | Default |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `boto3_session` | A `boto3.Session` instance under which AWS credentials are configured. | `None` |
| `region` | Region under which credentials are configured. Cannot use if providing `boto3_session`. | `us-east-1` |

### Provider Configs

| Parameter | Description | Example | Options |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- |
| `audio` | `AudioConfig` instance. | `{"voice": "tiffany"}` | [reference](../../../../../api-reference/python/experimental/bidi/types/model.md#strands.experimental.bidi.types.model.AudioConfig) |
| `inference` | Session start `inferenceConfiguration`'s (as snake_case). | `{"top_p": 0.9}` | [reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/nova/latest/userguide/input-events.html)

## Troubleshooting

### Module Not Found

If you encounter the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aws_sdk_bedrock_runtime'`, this means the experimental Bedrock runtime dependency hasn't been properly installed in your environment. To fix this, run `pip install 'strands-agents[bidi]'`.

!!! note "Python Version Requirement"
    Nova Sonic requires Python 3.12+ due to the experimental AWS SDK dependency. If you're using an older Python version, you'll need to upgrade.

### Hanging

When credentials are misconfigured, the model provider does not throw an exception (a quirk of the underlying experimental Bedrock client). As a result, the provider allows the user to proceed forward with a call to `receive`, which emits no events and thus presents an indefinite hanging behavior.

As a reminder, Nova Sonic is only available in us-east-1, eu-north-1, and ap-northeast-1.
